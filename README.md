### 🔍 The Problem  
Preparing for interviews is one of the most stressful and opaque parts of the job search. Candidates often struggle to:

- Anticipate the types of questions they’ll be asked  
- Deliver clear, structured, and compelling answers  
- Receive meaningful feedback on their performance  
- Track their progress and improve over time  

This lack of preparation leads to missed opportunities, low confidence, and poor outcomes—especially for students and early-career professionals.
