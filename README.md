# Project Charter - The Business Case

The goal of this charter is to move beyond "vibe coding" and establish a professional foundation for your project. Before you write application code, your team must define your project as a system of activities. This involves creating a compelling business case, defining your product's features from a user's perspective, and establishing a governance framework for how your team will operate.

This charter is the strategic blueprint for your proof-of-concept. A well-thought-out charter is the first and most critical step in convincing a funding committee that your team is worth investing in.

## The "Why"

It must clearly and concisely communicate the business purpose of your application. It should be written for a stakeholder who has five minutes to understand what you're doing and why it matters.

**Mission Statement**: A single, compelling sentence that summarizes your project's purpose.
**The Problem**: A clear description of the specific, high-value business problem or user pain point you are solving.
**Our Solution**: A high-level overview of how your AI application will address this problem.
**Target User**: A brief description of the primary user you are building this for.
