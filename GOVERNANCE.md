# Project Charter - The Operating Model

## The "How"

This is the most important document for defining your team's process. It demonstrates that you have thought carefully about how to manage your project and collaborate effectively. 

It must include: 

 **Team Roles & Responsibilities**: Define the initial roles for your team members (e.g., Project Lead for this stage, Technical Lead, etc.). These roles can and should rotate in later stages. 
 
 **Collaboration Protocol**: Detail your team's specific rules for using GitHub. How will you use Issues, Projects, and Discussions? What is your meeting schedule? How will you ensure all work is visible? 
 
 **AI Usage Strategy**: This is a critical section. Answer the following: 


  **Task Delegation**: 
  Which project activities are suited for ad-hoc assistance from an AI (e.g., brainstorming, debugging a snippet)? 
  Which activities are candidates for systematic automation using AI (e.g., generating unit tests, summarizing notes)? 
  
  **Collaboration Protocol**: 
    How will you strategically use AI as a collaborator? 
    What is your policy for verifying and citing AI contributions? 
  
  **Decision-Making Framework**: Briefly describe how your team will make decisions and resolve disagreements about features or technical approaches to ensure the project keeps moving forward.
